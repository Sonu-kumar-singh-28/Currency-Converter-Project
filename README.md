Currency Converter App (Python)

This project is a simple Currency Converter application developed using Python that allows users to convert one currency into another using real-time exchange rates. The application fetches live currency data from the ExchangeRate API, ensuring accurate and up-to-date conversions.

The app supports multiple international currencies and is lightweight, fast, and easy to use. It is especially suitable for beginners who want to learn how to work with APIs in Python.

Technologies used in this project include Python, the Requests library for making HTTP calls, and the ExchangeRate API for fetching live exchange rates.

To run this project, you need Python 3 installed on your system along with an active internet connection. The Requests library must be installed using pip before running the program.

Before running the application, users must create a free account on the ExchangeRate API website and generate an API key. This API key should be added to the Python file in the API_KEY variable.

The project structure is simple and contains a main Python file for currency conversion and a README file for documentation.

The application works by taking the source currency, target currency, and amount from the user. It then sends a request to the ExchangeRate API, retrieves the latest exchange rates, performs the conversion calculation, and displays the final converted amount.

Example usage of the application includes converting USD to INR, EUR to GBP, or any supported currency pair.

Future improvements for this project may include adding a graphical user interface using Tkinter, building a web version using Flask, creating an Android application using Kivy, caching exchange rates for offline use, and supporting historical exchange rate data.
